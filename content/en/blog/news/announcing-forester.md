Forester is a hackathon project that was revealed on DevConf 2023 to the public and a web page is being created today. Special thanks to the [docsy.dev](https://www.docsy.dev/) template and Strojírna Novotný for images of their forestry machinery. For more info, pay a visit to [loader.cz](https://www.loader.cz). And finally to my colleague Ondra Ezr for putting the initial version together.

I drawn the logo myself, it is supposed to be an arborist helmet that is widely used in forestry as well. A new, professional logo, will be hopefully announced on this blog in the near future.

I believe Fedora do not have a good unattended image-based bare-metal provisioning story and Forester is here for the rescue. I will report on this blog going forward as I gather more feedback from the community and Red Hat customers.

Please keep in mind that Forester is in early stage of development, it is currently not intended for production use as it lacks many planned features.

As always, please give us [feedback](https://github.com/foresterorg/forester/discussions/new?category=general) on what you think about Forester.
