I am happy to announce the first ever release 0.0.3. Previous versions were used for tuning the GitHub Action which builds the release artifacts and the third one was the first one to work properly.

Initial features:

* Image management and extraction
* Bootloader management
* Kickstart management
* Appliance creation and enlisting
* System list and show commands
* Acquire and release commands
* Containerized deployment
* Redfish and libvirt drivers

The version was tested on libvirt and Dell PowerEdge 350.

The main goal of this release is to gather feedback on the provisioning workflow.
